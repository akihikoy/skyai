* Installation using CMake
Note: using CMake is tentative.

** Requirements
- CMake
- cmake-gui, ccmake, etc. (option)

** Installation
In SkyAI's base directory, execute commands as follows:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ccmake ..

Here, you can use some alternatives of cmake.  cmake-gui is a good alternative for beginners.

[Case of using ccmake]
- Run Configure (press c key).
- (Read message, then press e key).
- Change variables:
  BUILD_*: Default values are OK.
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: /home/your-account/local  (recommended).
  ODE_BUILD_DIR or ODE_INSTALL_DIR: If you built ODE without installation (without executing "make install"), specify the build path (path to the base directory of ODE) in ODE_BUILD_DIR; in this case, keep ODE_INSTALL_DIR blank.  Otherwise, specify the install directory (/usr, /usr/local, etc.) in ODE_INSTALL_DIR.
- Run Generate (press g key).
- (Exit ccmake).

Make the project:
$ make

# If you want to install the project, execute:
# $ make install
# but, this is optional; you can use the program without this process; see "Using SkyAI on the build directory" to use.
# After executing "make install", the programs and the supplementary files are installed into CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.  See "Using SkyAI on the install directory" to use.

** Using SkyAI on the build directory
Go to the build directory, then execute:
$ cd benchmarks
$ cd maze2d
$ ./maze2d.out -path ../cmn,m -agent ql_da1
The other usages are written in skyai.org.

** Using SkyAI on the install directory
Go to the binary directory (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin), then execute:
$ cd skyai
$ cd maze2d
$ ./maze2d.out -path ../cmn,m -agent ql_da1
The other usages are written in skyai.org.
